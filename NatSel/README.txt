The Genetic Algorithm code is located in "GenAlg.py".
The implementation-specific code is must "implement" the interface in "AbstractFunctionClass.py". A non-finished example is in "TestFunctionClass.py". See the old Lua code files for the old V-REP implementation (without the remote API)
"Main.py" was how I tried to test it. Everything is DEFINITELY not tested, so beware...

All the things related to connecting it to V-REP is copied from Alireza's folder "TIF160_Bioloid/Codes/PythonExample.zip", and something doesn't work here. Didn't have time to figure out what the problem was.
